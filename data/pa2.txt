DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
[0090] The inventor has conceived, and reduced to practice, a semantic search and  
ecommendation system which integrates with an AI platform to provide advanced search 
capabilities by leveraging automatically generated ontologies and knowledge graphs.  
The system employs natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence 
techniques (e.g., large language models) to create, update, and align and evolve ontologies 
and curate ontological data from diverse data sources while also creating vector semantic 
indices and traditional database indices. It supports context-aware multimodal query 
interpretation and enhancement, personalized results, and complex reasoning by 
incorporating user context, feedback, and domain knowledge with both connectionist and 
symbolic modeling caраbilities.  
The neurosymbolic system optimizes search performance and efficiency through indexing 
techniques, distributed computing, and continuous learning and knowledge corporate 
curation. With a modular architecture and scalable infrastructure, the semantic search system 
enables users to retrieve relevant, meaningful, and context-specific information from vast 
amounts of structured and unstructured data and existing or developed knowledge corpora. 
The integration of the semantic search system with the AI platform's components, such as 
knowledge graphs and model blending or consensus or checks against authoritative symbolic 
knowledge bases for specific elements (e.g., checking recommended prescriptions for known 
dangerous drug interactions in a formal database), enhances the platform's overall reasoning, 
decision-making, and problemsolving capabilities, empowering users with intelligent and 
intuitive search experiences across various domains and applications with superior assurance 
of appropriateness and utility when compared to current search responses from generative 
AI tools. 
[0091] The composite AI platform comprises a set of neural network models that generate 
vector embeddings representing input data elements. The embeddings are stored in 
databases (or in block storage like AWS S3 or Ceph). 
Additional indices linking vectorized data element representations to ontology elements are 
created and iteratively refined using contextual information from comparisons between 
ontological data from knowledge graphs containing facts, entities, and relations using at least 
vector similarity comparison as part of a comparative objective function for relevance. This 
iterative refinement process allows the system to continuously learn and improve the 
accuracy and relevance of its links between vector semantic representations and ontological 
representations of data and to add to and curate multiple structured and even symbolic 
representations of data elements into effective knowledge corpora for specialized and broad
based search, reasoning and model training or utilization. The typical knowledge graph 
comprises nodes representing entities, concepts, and relationships, and edges representing 
the connections between them. 
The nodes are categorized into different types, such as classes, instances, and properties, 
based on their semantic roles. The edges are labeled with the specific relationships they 
represent, such as 'is-a', 'part-of, or 'has-property'. 
This structured representation allows for efficient traversal and reasoning over the property 
graph. The system employs various reasoning and inference techniques, such as logical 
reasoning, rule-based inference, and graph pattern matching, to derive new knowledge and 
insights from the knowledge graph. For example, the system may use first-order logic to infer 
new facts based on existing relationships, or apply graph algorithms like shortest path or 
centrality measures to identify important entities and connections. Each of the nodes may 
also contain property information linking it to vectorized representation of its constituent data 
elements. Nodes and subgraphs may also be linked to supporting source content from which 
such elements were derived and may also reflect metadata about the provenance of the 
analysis (e.g., the model and its associated training data and author and history and license 
terms) which classified such elements or element properties into the symbolic knowledge 
base. 
[0092] Combined with models, logic (e.g., Datalog) the knowledge graph enables complex 
reasoning tasks such as entity disambiguation, question answering, and recommendation. For 
instance, when a user searches for 'apple', the system can disambiguate between the fruit and 
the technology company by analyzing the context and relationships in the knowledge graph 
and in the vector semantics index. In simple cases, one of those techniques may be enough, 
in complex cases the combined value of the approaches is superior. Similarly, the system can 
answer complex questions like 'What are the top companies in the renewable energy sector?' 
by traversing the relevant nodes and edges. By integrating information from ontologies, 
semantic indices, and external sources, the knowledge graph with complementary vector 
semantic enhancements provides a comprehensive and interconnected view of the domain. 
This rich context facilitates more accurate and nuanced reasoning and inference. For example, 
combining company data from financial databases with industry ontologies (e.g., FIBO) 
enables the system to infer market trends and competitors. 
[0093] Contextual information, such as user preferences, search history, device from which a 
query or recommendation is being sought, recent history of environmental conditions and 
movement (e.g., just ran through the rain), and location (historical, present and planned-such 
as from an upcoming calendar invite), plays a role in guiding the reasoning and inference 
process the system can employ to maximize search or recommendation relevance with 
minimal user interaction requirements. The system leverages this context to personalize and 
refine the results, ensuring their relevance to the user's specific needs and intentions and to 
aid the user in switching between multiple devices such as a watch, smart glasses, a VR/AR 
headset, a laptop or a tablet with a task or workflow based continuity model. For instance, a 
user's past searches, application use and state, and system interactions can inform the 
composite computing system about their interests, current tasks of interest and expertise 
level, allowing it to adapt the reasoning strategies and provide more targeted insights relevant 
to their current context and time available. Suggested content and interface presentation to 
a user who is switching between a laptop and 
a VisionPro on their couch or at their desk late at night and is methodically researching and 
citing sources in a paper deserves very substantively different treatment than the harried 
commuter who is late for work and sprinted from the subway station to a nearby awning and 
is desperately searching for coffee with a minimal line on their way to their office.  
[0094] Model orchestration is handled through a hierarchical process definition that allows 
efficient routing of processing tasks to at least one specialized model(s) and to declare 
different assurance levels based on certainty thresholds and authoritative knowledge or 
challenge-based verification.  
This can be linked to time (e.g., how fast can the recommendation be fielded), cost (what will 
it cost me monetarily or in trade such as in personal data), or risk (the difference between 
which medicines might cause a fatal drug interaction or is it faster to take the backroad or the 
highway home). This ensures that the most suitable model or gaggle of models is selected for 
each task (or subtask), optimizing performance and accuracy. Models are blended using 
expressive weighting schemes to combine their strengths and mitigating individual 
weaknesses. Coordinating models may also identify specific areas of expertise which demand 
higher levels of assurance or quality (e.g., the drug example) that may be elevated by the 
provider sepаrately from user intentions or preferences for provider purposes such as brand, 
legal or liability reasons. 
[0095] Comprehensive feedback loops integrate considerations of security, licensing, 
economic factors, energy consumption, data/model provenance and traceability to facilitate 
collaborative model and knowledge corpus development.  
Provenance graphing and administrative details captured by the system enable federated 
ownership of such system components when multiple economic counterparties are 
collaborating and support accountability even when a monolithic ownership or execution 
structure is in place. 
[0096] For generative workflows such as scene or sequence creation, the system maintains 
overall and element specific consistency by aligning entities, narrative elements, and positions 
across frames in space and time (or at least in order). Knowledge graph and vector 
representations or embeddings lookups supplement scene refinement and consistency 
efficiency.  
Multi-modal generation harmonizes various senses like sound and smell, while expert models 
or curated knowledge elements verify specific elements.  
Since multimodal query ingest and contextualization is akin to classifying scenes in a 
generative process like a cinematic video generation process, we note that intensive video and 
audio and sensor data rates are much higher than typical textual input.  
Often such material is also not perfectly synchronized with the language or text from a user 
or a description of such content.  
The velocity and volume of data in such cases requires efficient separation of multimodal 
elements into focused model elements. 
[0097] Modality specific modeling classification elements supervised by a Coordinating 
process element in a distributed computational graph orchestrated processes allows for 
sequential representation of key elements and candidate classifications (e.g., objects, entities, 
relationships, positions) of such elements within and across modalities.  
System may elect into classification processes which are time independent or autoregressive 
(or both) to enable extraction of specific candidate facts, context, or snippets.  
Time independent, sequential or autoregressive meanings from such classification processes 
(usually connectionist) are then compared to vectorized content and knowledge graph 
content to refine the candidate meanings of the user input or inputs. The resulting output in 
the form of a structured query, an ontologically compliant expression of a query, or processed 
multimodal or textual prompt can then be passed to at least one artificial intelligence model 
(e.g., an LLM or diffusion model or variational autoencoder or kolmogorov Arnold networks) 
or simulation model for analysis by system. In the generative case, comparisons between time 
independent, sequential and autoregressive scene elements across content within and across 
modalities allows for more efficient hierarchically recursive generation of content elements 
and combinations of content elements as building blocks for sensor feature representations 
(e.g., audio, video, smell, kinematic, accessibility like braille or sign language) of content.
